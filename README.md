# neural-network-challenge-2

## About

In this notebook, I train a neural network to predict whether employees are likely to leave a company and which department that best fits each employee using a branched neural network.

## Key Features
- Sci-kit learn
- Tensorflow
- Standard Scaler
- Accuracy score
- One Hot Encoder
- Label Encoding
- Branch Neural Networks
